### How does this work

There is a special file in your phone - Its called com.apple.MobileGestalt.plist

>But First what is a .plist file? 

It is a file type by apple to make storing information more easier and safer.

>Now what is this file for and what does it contain?

This file contains important system Information vis keys, Keys are similar to the windows registry but are VERY important to the device because its how iPhone stores data. 

Now that you know some information. Lets go over how this expliot works

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There is a chance your device might bootloop, I am not responsible if that occours. 
> Continue at your own risk.

This will restore your phone into a fallback state where no system files are being used. This will allow us to replace the file with modified keys added into the plist file and put it back in the phone. Your phone should restart after this is complete.

Now your phone will launch with the modifed keys added into your phone. Don't worry as you can restore the tweaks if you dont want them anymore

### Is this project open-source

Unfortuntly but for a good reason, This project is a closed source app, however we still can tell you what we used to make it;

- libimobiledevice3
- Python
- Visual Studio Code
- PyQt
- fingers
- Mac
- Nugget 3.0 Source code

The reason we can't give out the source code is because you're going to throw up because of the code structure (idek what half the code is doing)
